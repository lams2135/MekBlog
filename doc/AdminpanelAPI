# the feature is like Github settings

# layer structure of AP is [EXTENSION -> block -> row]
# we packed HTML form elems into several marks
# so that mark down the specific labels to make mekblog.adminpanel to create the form, and push the states to a handle function that linked to the EXTENSION

# API

## register will be automatically called by mekblog.extension.load
mekblog.adminpanel.register()

## when changes submitted, EXTENSION.apply_settings(obj) will be called, that means an EXTENSION with adminpanel enabled must provide this interface.
## the handle function must return a <BOOL, STRING>, with True for succeeded, False for failed, STRING would be printed on the webpage if failed.
## the whole submit process acts as AJAX way.
## or we can use event system instead by direct calling handle function EXTENSION. -> discuss it


# PACKED HTML ELEMS

## p
## label
## inputs
## other HTML form plugins

## discuss and make detailed rules for the elems later.

# WATCH examples in 'extension/test_walter'
